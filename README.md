# MMEinR
R version of Witkovsky's Matlab implementation of iterative solving of Henderson's mixed model equations.

For the R version of an algorithm see the MMEinR.R file (function) available at

For the current status of the MATLAB algorithm (not an identical clone) see the mixed.m file (function) available at
